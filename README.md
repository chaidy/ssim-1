# ssim
A single and multi-scale SSIM implementation in C++

This source computes the PSNR and the SSIM index, a quality index
defined by Wang, Bovik, Sheihk and Simoncelli that uses a top-down
approach to image quality assessment, based on the following
article of the above authors:

Image Quality Assessment: From Error Measuement to Structural
Similarity, IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, Vol. 13, 2004.

The code was written by Felix Oum and Thomas Richter, and is based
on the IMCO framework, developed by Thomas Richter for the
image compression project of the TU Berlin. For legal restrictions,
